To be honest to the Github GUI is intimidating to me. Not because it’s difficult to understand, or I don’t know what I’m looking at, but 
because it reminds me of coding (as it should) and I traditionally can’t stand coding. But I suppose that means it must be well designed, right? 
That being said Github is not new to me. I’ve spent plenty of time on the website already due to my solo game design projects in the past so I already 
have some understanding of how the website works. I spent some time navigating the site and checking things out, but eventually I downloaded the desktop app, 
and I found that somewhat more appealing. It uses an interface that I’m actually more comfortable with, as it reminds me of a game development pipeline application. 
Besides all of that, I don’t really have anything else to say about it. The Kahoot quiz was cool, and I like the competitive aspect of it.
